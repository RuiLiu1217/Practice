/* 
Tag: string, overflow consideration
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as 
necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. 
Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial 
plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as 
possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form 
the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the 
behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

Input: "42"        :        Output: 42
Input: "   -42"    :        Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Input: "4193 with words"     :      Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

Input: "words and 987"       :      Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

Input: "-91283472332"        :      Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

TODO: Too much details need to be considered

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.
You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.
The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth 
second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. 
For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second 
level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"             :          Output: -1

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a 
third level revision number, which means its third level

During the NBA playoffs, we always arrange the rather strong team to play with the rather weak team, like make the rank 1 team play with the rank nth team, which is a good strategy to make the contest more interesting. Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.

The n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: (1,2)
Explanation: 
Initially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.
Then we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.
Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: ((1,4),(2,3))
Explanation: 
In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.
And we got (1,4),(2,3).
In the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.
And we got the final answer ((1,4),(2,3)).
Example 3:
Input: 8
Output: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Explanation: 
First round: (1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)
Second round: ((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))
Third round: (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6)))
Since the third round will generate the final winner, you need to output the answer (((1,8),(4,5)),((2,7),(3,6))).
Note:
The n is in range [2, 212].
We ensure that the input n can be converted into the form 2k, where k is a positive integer.

/*
We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like "(1, 3)" or "(2, 0.5)".  Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, 
and spaces, and ended up with the string S.  Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our 
original coordinates could have been.
Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", 
"1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with less digits. Also, a decimal point within 
a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1".
The final answer list can be returned in any order.  Also note that all coordinates in the final answer have 
exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)

Input: "(123)"
Output: ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]

Input: "(00011)"
Output:  ["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]
Explanation: 
0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.

Input: "(0123)"
Output: ["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)", "(0.12, 3)"]

Input: "(100)"
Output: [(10, 0)]
Explanation: 
1.0 is not allowed.

Note:

4 <= S.length <= 12.
S[0] = "(", S[S.length - 1] = ")", and the other elements in S are digits.
