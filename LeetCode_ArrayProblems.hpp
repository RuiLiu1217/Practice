According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, 
is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). 
Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using 
the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current 
state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in
the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
Follow up:
1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: 
You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, 
which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. 
How would you address these problems?

Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row R and column C that align with all the following rules:

Row R and column C both contain exactly N black pixels.
For all rows that have a black pixel at column C, they should be exactly the same as row R
The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

Example:
Input:                                            
[['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']] 

N = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: All the bold 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column 1 and 3).
        0    1    2    3    4    5         column index                                            
0    [['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
1     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
2     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
3     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]    
row index

Take 'B' at row R = 0 and column C = 1 as an example:
Rule 1, row R = 0 and column C = 1 both have exactly N = 3 black pixels. 
Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column C = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row R = 0.

Solution:  给了一个整数N，说对于均含有N个个黑像素的某行某列，如果该列中所有的黑像素所在的行都相同的话，该列的
    所有黑像素均为孤独的像素，让我们统计所有的这样的孤独的像素的个数。那么跟之前那题类似，我们还是要
    统计每一行每一列的黑像素的个数，而且由于条件二中要比较各行之间是否相等，如果一个字符一个字符的比
    较写起来比较麻烦，我们可以用个trick，把每行的字符连起来，形成一个字符串，然后直接比较两个字符串
    是否相等会简单很多。然后我们遍历每一行和每一列, 如果某行和某列的黑像素刚好均为N，我们遍历该列的所
    有黑像素，如果其所在行均相等，则说明该列的所有黑像素均为孤独的像素，将个数加入结果res中，然后将该
    行的黑像素统计个数清零，以免重复运算，这样我们就可以求出所有的孤独的像素了.
