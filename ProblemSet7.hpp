/*
Given a list of directory info including directory path, and all the files with contents in this 
directory, you need to find out all the groups of duplicate files in the file system in terms of 
their paths.
A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have exactly the same content.
A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:
"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"
It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt with content f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content, respectively) 
in directory root/d1/d2/.../dm. Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The output is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file 
paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:

"directory_path/file_name.txt"

Input:
["root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)", "root/c 3.txt(abcd)", "root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)", "root 4.txt(efgh)"]
Output:  
[["root/a/2.txt","root/c/d/4.txt","root/4.txt"],["root/a/1.txt","root/c/3.txt"]]

Note:

No order is required for the final output.
You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and digits, 
and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].

The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].
You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.
You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path and 
file info are separated by a single blank space.

Follow-up beyond contest:
Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?
If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?
If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?
What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?
How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is

622. Design Circular Queue
Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a 
linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO 
(First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to 
the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the 
spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, 
we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the 
queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Your implementation should support following operations:

MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 

Example:

MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3
circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4

Design your implementation of the circular double-ended queue (deque).

insertLast(): Adds an item at the rear of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.
deleteFront(): Deletes an item from the front of Deque. Return true if the operation is successful.

Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules:

The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
The column number n should always be an odd number.
The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of 
the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs 
will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom 
part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the 
right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom 
part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is 
not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still need to 
leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two subtrees 
are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them.
