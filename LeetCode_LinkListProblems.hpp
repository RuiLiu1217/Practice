Sort a linked list using insertion sort.
A graphical example of insertion sort. The partial sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list.
With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list
Algorithm of Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
It repeats until no input elements remain.

Example 1:

Input: 4->2->1->3
Output: 1->2->3->4
Example 2:

Input: -1->5->3->4->0
Output: -1->0->3->4->5

Tag: single linked list

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the
intersected node in B.
 

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the 
intersected node in B.


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5].
Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be 
arbitrary values. Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
