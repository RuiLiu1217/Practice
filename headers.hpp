    Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
    For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve 
    is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, 
    which is XX + V + II.
    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the 
    numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one 
    is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number 
    nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

    from 1 to 3999.

        Solution
            1. assume that A and B are the two elements which we want to find;
            2. use XOR for all elements,the result is : r = A^B,we just need 
            to distinguish A from B next step;
            3. if we can find a bit '1' in r,then the bit in corresponding 
                position in A and B must be different.We can use 
                {last = r & (~(r-1))} to get the last bit 1 int r;
            4. we use last to divide all numbers into two groups,then A and B 
                must fall into the two distrinct groups. XOR elements in eash 
                group,get the A and B.

        Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
        Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a 
        letter in pattern and a non - empty word in str.
        
        Example 1:
            Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
            Output : true
        Example 2 :

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent
the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent
the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant
bit on the right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of
LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch
could represent.

Example:
    Input: n = 1
    Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", 
            "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]

Note:
    The order of output does not matter.
    The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00"
    is not valid, it should be "1:00". The minute must be consist 
    of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example 
    "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".
