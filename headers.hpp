/*
In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].
You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:

1. Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
2. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.

Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must 
perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each 
basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].

Input: [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].

Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].

Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.

In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].
Now, we would like to implement the following query function: 
TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was 
leading the election at time t.  
Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a 
tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.
For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.
Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.
If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail 
sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. 
For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address. 
(Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)
If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. 
This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to
my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

DP[n][|i-h|] = max(DP[n][|i-h|], DP[n-1][i] + min(h, i)); // 如果把第n个柱子放在矮的那边，公共高度一定是增长了 min(i, h), 高度差就变成了 |i-h|

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" 
characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's 
(and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.
Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of the 
Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the 
White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can 
attack the King.


Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:  
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row. 
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column. 
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal. 
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1]. 
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0]. 
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.

Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]

Given a function  f(x, y) and a value z, return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z.
The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:

The function interface is defined like this:

functions from the list.

You may return the solutions in any order.

Input: function_id = 1, z = 5

    Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected 
    back to the left wall.

    You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words
    in words matches the pattern. A word matches the pattern if there exists 
    a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the 
    pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
    (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: 
    every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)
    
    Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern.
    You may return the answer in any order.
    
    1 <= words.length <= 501<=words.length<=50
    1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 201<=pattern.length=words[i].length<=20
    
    Example
    Example 1:
    Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
    Output: ["aqq","mee"]
    
    Explanation: 
    "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
    "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
    since a and b map to the same letter.
    
    Example 2:
    Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
    Output: ["a","b","c"]
