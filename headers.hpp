// We want to use quad trees to store an N x N boolean grid. Each cell in the
// grid can only be true or false. The root node represents the whole grid. For
// each node, it will be subdivided into four children nodes until the values in
// the region it represents are all the same.
// Each node has another two boolean attributes : isLeaf and val. isLeaf is true
// if and only if the node is a leaf node. The valattribute for a leaf node contains
// the value of the region it represents.
// Your task is to use a quad tree to represent a given grid.

// 这是一道比较简单的题目，主要注意点就是先判断一个矩阵中的值是否一致，在看分隔中是否一致

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal 
of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:
    We should return its level order traversal:
    [
        [1],
        [3,2,4],
        [5,6]
    ]
Note:
    The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
    The total number of nodes is at most 5000.

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative 
ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, 
who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" 
and "Bronze Medal".

Example 1:
    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
    Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three 
    highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and 
    "Bronze Medal".
    For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative 
    ranks according to their scores.
Note:
    N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
    All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, 
that player makes a move consisting of:
Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.

Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.

Note:
    1 <= N <= 1000
