            lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place. The length after 
compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: 
["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 
Example 2:
Input:
["a"]
Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.

Example 3:
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: 
["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. 
"bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12". Notice each digit has it's own entry 
in the array.
