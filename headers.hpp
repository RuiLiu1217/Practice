For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as

The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a

   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", 
where # represents a null node.
Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal 
serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.

Example:
Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/((100/10)/2)" are redundant, 
since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)". 

Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of

622. Design Circular Queue
Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a 
linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO 
(First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to 
the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the 
spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, 
we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the 
queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Your implementation should support following operations:

MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 

Example:

MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3
circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. 
Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after 
it completes its moves.
The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] 
represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), 
and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of 
its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always 
make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, 
etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same 
for each move.

Input: "UD"
Output: true 
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have 
the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. 
Therefore, we return true.

Input: "LL"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two "moves" to the 
left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at 
the end of its moves.

We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
Note:

1 <= len(start) = len(end) <= 10000.
Both start and end will only consist of characters in {'L', 'R', 'X'}.
这道题由于理解错误，以为XL 和 LX 是可以互相变的， RX 和 XR 也是可以互相变的。
实际上，题目中给出的条件是 XL 只能单向变成 LX， 而 RX 只能单向变成 XR。
那么问题就变得简单了许多，这样想，如果只是单向变化，那么L在start中的位置相对于
end只能靠后，而 R 在start 中的位置相对于end只能靠前。换句话说，L 只能往前走，
而R 只能往后走。而且L, R 在两个字符串中的相对位置无法变化。

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is 
mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" 
maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet 
is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..",
"--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-",
"-.--","--.."]

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of 
the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...", 
(which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a 
concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]

Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building 
located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any 
amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to 
be a building as well. 
At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, 
bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's 
skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed 
from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

Example:
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4], 
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:

gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],

A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have

we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and 
"com" implicitly.
Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), 
followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".
We are given a list cpdomains of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, 
(in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.

Example 1:
Input: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
Explanation: 
We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and 
"com" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Input: 
["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output: 
["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation: 
We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. 
For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.

 838 Push Dominoes
There are N dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright.
In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the 
left or to the right. After each second, each domino that is falling to the 
left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling 
to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays 
still due to the balance of the forces. For the purposes of this question, 
we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a 
falling or already fallen domino.

You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words 
matches the pattern. A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of 
letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get 
the desired word. (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters 
to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"

Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,

Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

FreqStack has two functions:

push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 
Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
 

Note:

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" 
characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's 
(and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can 
attack the King.


Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:  
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row. 
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column. 
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal. 
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1]. 
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0]. 
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.
