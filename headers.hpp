Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a 
"boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between 
i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and 
coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
Example:

Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2
Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]

Example 1:

    Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three

    "Bronze Medal".
    For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative

Given a 2D array A, each cell is 0 (representing sea) or 1 (representing

another land square, or off the boundary of the grid. Return the number of

grid in any number of moves. 

Example 1:

Input: [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that isn't enclosed 
because its on the boundary.
Example 2:

Input: [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn,

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
