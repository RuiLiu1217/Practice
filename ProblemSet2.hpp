/*
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the
intersected node in B.
 

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the 
intersected node in B.


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5].
Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be 
arbitrary values. Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]          :         Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]    :         Output: 1 or 5

element twice.

            notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed
