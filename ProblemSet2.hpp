    Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
        push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
        pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
        top() -- Get the top element.
        getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
    Example:
        MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
        minStack.push(-2);
        minStack.push(0);
        minStack.push(-3);
        minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
        minStack.pop();
        minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
        minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.

/*
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the
intersected node in B.
 

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two 
lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as 
[3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the 
intersected node in B.


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5].
Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be 
arbitrary values. Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array 
nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array 
may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]          :         Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]    :         Output: 1 or 5

or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

element twice.

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

            notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed
