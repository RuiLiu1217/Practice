Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive 
integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the 
process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle 
which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

/*
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house 
has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in 
a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, 
adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact 
the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each 
house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting 
the police.

Input: [2,3,2]            :            Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
because they are adjacent houses.

Input: [1,2,3,1]          :            Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Example:

MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop
from top, size, and is empty operations are valid. Depending on your language, stack may 
not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended 
queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack. You may assume that all 
operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

            Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common 
            ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
            
            According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: The lowest 
            common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the 
            lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where 
            we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
            
            Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
                _______6______
               /              \

           0       4       7       9
         /  \
        3   5

        Example 1:
            Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
            Output: 6
            Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
        Example 2:
            Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
            Output: 2
            Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node 
            can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
        Note:
            All of the nodes' values will be unique. p and q are different 
            and both values will exist in the BST.
        Challenge: 
            Think about the case that the tree is not a binary search tree?

        Find the two elements that appear only once.
        
        Example:

            Output: [3,5]
        Note:
        The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, 
        [5, 3] is also correct. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime 
        complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space 
        complexity?
        
        Solution
            1. assume that A and B are the two elements which we want to find;
            2. use XOR for all elements,the result is : r = A^B,we just need 
            to distinguish A from B next step;
            3. if we can find a bit '1' in r,then the bit in corresponding 
                position in A and B must be different.We can use 
                {last = r & (~(r-1))} to get the last bit 1 int r;
            4. we use last to divide all numbers into two groups,then A and B 
                must fall into the two distrinct groups. XOR elements in eash 
                group,get the A and B.
