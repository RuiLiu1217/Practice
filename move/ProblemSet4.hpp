Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits 
from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:
You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.
Example:
X..X
...X
...X
In the above board there are 2 battleships.
Invalid Example:
...X
XXXX

This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.

Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and 
previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not 
point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one
or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data
 structure, as shown in the example below.
Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly 
linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL

Input: head = []

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices 
from "A", "C", "G", "T". Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation 
(mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single 
character changed in the gene string.

For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.
Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. 
A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.
Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the 
minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there 
is no such a mutation, return -1.

Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
You may assume start and end string is not the same.

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed 
factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content 
with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie 
j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize 
the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.

Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children 
are 1, 2, 3. And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, 
you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.
General case:
If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many 
pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? There is 
exactly one bucket with poison.
Note:

A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, 
and the feeding takes no time. After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, 
there has to be a cool down time of m minutes. During this time, only observation is 
allowed and no feedings at all. Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any 
integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach 
or exceed 100 wins.
What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of 
numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal, 
determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both 
players play optimally.

You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 
20 and desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.

Input:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:
false

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers 
from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is

A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences

The first few elements of string S is the following: S =

There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up,
